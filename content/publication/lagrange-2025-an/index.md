abstract: We propose a greedy search-and-score algorithm for ancestral graphs, which
  include directed as well as bidirected edges, originating from unobserved latent
  variables. The normalized likelihood score of ancestral graphs is estimated in terms
  of multivariate information over relevant textitac-connected subsets of vertices,
  $C$, that are connected through collider paths confined to the ancestor set of $C$.
  For computational efficiency, the proposed two-step algorithm relies on local information
  scores limited to the close surrounding vertices of each node (step~1) and edge
  (step~2). This computational strategy, although restricted to information contributions
  from textitac-connected subsets containing up to two-collider paths, is shown to
  outperform state-of-the-art causal discovery methods on challenging benchmark datasets.
