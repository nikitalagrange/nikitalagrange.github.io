abstract: 
  The result of collaborative and interdisciplinary work involving a teacher-researcher, an instructional designer, a research engineer, and a PhD student, this contribution aims to rethink the methods, tools, and pedagogical approaches offered to students in order to improve their learning. In this context, we transformed a teaching unit (UE), integrating active pedagogical strategies and distance learning activities, and then assessed the impact of the transformations as part of a continuous improvement process. Here, we present feedback from 29 students on their perceptions of the “Numerical Modeling in Physics” training scheme in the second year of their bachelor's degree. The results open up new avenues for reflection, both in terms of pedagogical engineering and the evaluation of this type of training system.
