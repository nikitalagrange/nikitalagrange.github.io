abstract: Generating synthetic data from medical records is a complex task intensified
  by patient privacy concerns. In recent years, multiple approaches have been reported
  for the generation of synthetic data, however, limited attention was given to jointly
  evaluate the quality and the privacy of the generated data. The quality and privacy
  of synthetic data stem from multivariate associations across variables, which cannot
  be assessed by comparing univariate distributions with the original data. Here,
  we introduce a novel algorithm (MIIC-SDG) for generating synthetic data from electronic
  records based on a multivariate information framework and Bayesian network theory.
  We also propose a new metric to quantitatively assess the trade-off between the
  Quality and Privacy Scores (QPS) of synthetic data generation methods. The performance
  of MIIC-SDG is demonstrated on different clinical datasets and favorably compares
  with state-of-the-art synthetic data generation methods, based on the QPS trade-off
  between several quality and privacy metrics.
