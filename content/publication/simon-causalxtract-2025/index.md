abstract: Live-cell microscopy routinely provides massive amounts of time-lapse images
  of complex cellular systems under various physiological or therapeutic conditions.
  However, this wealth of data remains difficult to interpret in terms of causal effects.
  Here, we describe CausalXtract, a flexible computational pipeline that discovers
  causal and possibly time-lagged effects from morphodynamic features and cell–cell
  interactions in live-cell imaging data. CausalXtract methodology combines network-based
  and information-based frameworks, which is shown to discover causal effects overlooked
  by classical Granger and Schreiber causality approaches. We showcase the use of
  CausalXtract to uncover novel causal effects in a tumor-on-chip cellular ecosystem
  under therapeutically relevant conditions. In particular, we find that cancer-associated
  fibroblasts directly inhibit cancer cell apoptosis, independently from anticancer
  treatment. CausalXtract uncovers also multiple antagonistic effects at different
  time delays. Hence, CausalXtract provides a unique computational tool to interpret
  live-cell imaging data for a range of fundamental and translational research applications.
