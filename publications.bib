	abstract = {Live-cell microscopy routinely provides massive amounts of time-lapse images of complex cellular systems under various physiological or therapeutic conditions. However, this wealth of data remains difficult to interpret in terms of causal effects. Here, we describe CausalXtract, a flexible computational pipeline that discovers causal and possibly time-lagged effects from morphodynamic features and cell–cell interactions in live-cell imaging data. CausalXtract methodology combines network-based and information-based frameworks, which is shown to discover causal effects overlooked by classical Granger and Schreiber causality approaches. We showcase the use of CausalXtract to uncover novel causal effects in a tumor-on-chip cellular ecosystem under therapeutically relevant conditions. In particular, we find that cancer-associated fibroblasts directly inhibit cancer cell apoptosis, independently from anticancer treatment. CausalXtract uncovers also multiple antagonistic effects at different time delays. Hence, CausalXtract provides a unique computational tool to interpret live-cell imaging data for a range of fundamental and translational research applications.},

	abstract = {Generating synthetic data from medical records is a complex task intensified by patient privacy concerns. In recent years, multiple approaches have been reported for the generation of synthetic data, however, limited attention was given to jointly evaluate the quality and the privacy of the generated data. The quality and privacy of synthetic data stem from multivariate associations across variables, which cannot be assessed by comparing univariate distributions with the original data. Here, we introduce a novel algorithm (MIIC-SDG) for generating synthetic data from electronic records based on a multivariate information framework and Bayesian network theory. We also propose a new metric to quantitatively assess the trade-off between the Quality and Privacy Scores (QPS) of synthetic data generation methods. The performance of MIIC-SDG is demonstrated on different clinical datasets and favorably compares with state-of-the-art synthetic data generation methods, based on the QPS trade-off between several quality and privacy metrics.},

	abstract = {We propose a greedy search-and-score algorithm for ancestral graphs, which include directed as well as bidirected edges, originating from unobserved latent variables. The normalized likelihood score of ancestral graphs is estimated in terms of multivariate information over relevant ``ac-connected subsets'' of vertices, C, that are connected through collider paths confined to the ancestor set of C. For computational efficiency, the proposed two-step algorithm relies on local information scores limited to the close surrounding vertices of each node (step 1) and edge (step 2). This computational strategy, although restricted to information contributions from ac-connected subsets containing up to two-collider paths, is shown to outperform state-of-the-art causal discovery methods on challenging benchmark datasets.},
